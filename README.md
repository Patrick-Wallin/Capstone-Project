# Capstone-Project
This project is part of Android Developer Nanodegreeâ€™s program at Udacity.  It started from nothing to an app by myself to keep up with my skill in the following: layouts, Adapter, Loader, ContentProvider, Activity, Fragment, loading data from internet, SQLite database (SQLiteOpenHelper), AsyncTask, RecyclerView, ViewHolder, and widgets.

It allow users to search for colleges based on search input such as degree, program, location, or name.  The app will populate the list of colleges and allow them to save it into their app as "favorite".  The favorites would be stored on their device for future looking up on the app.  The app will include detail information about college such as website, address, cost, and SAT/ACT score.
